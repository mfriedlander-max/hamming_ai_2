# Branch: feat/project-setup

**Purpose**: Baseline Next.js 14 App Router scaffold with Tailwind, Dexie schema, type definitions, layout shell, and shadcn/ui primitives.
**Scope**: Frontend foundation only. No upload, analysis, suggestions, or history features.
**Builds on**: none (starting point).
**What’s included**:
- Next.js app directory structure, global styles, Header/PageContainer.
- Tailwind config, base fonts/colors, and shadcn/ui setup.
- Dexie client + base tables, TypeScript domain types.
- Minimal landing page placeholder.

**Notes**: This branch is intentionally minimal to serve as the base for all other feature branches. Use this as the clean reset point if later branches need to be rebased.
