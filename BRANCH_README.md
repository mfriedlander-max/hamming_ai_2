# Branch: PLACEHOLDER

**Purpose**: Mirrors current integrated state (analysis engine and earlier) until feature-specific commits are isolated.
**Scope**: Currently identical to feat/analysis-engine; includes upload, analysis, and UI present in that branch.
**Builds on**: feat/analysis-engine (temporary alignment).

**Notes**: This branch will diverge when feature-specific work is available. For now it serves as a placeholder pointer to the integrated baseline.
